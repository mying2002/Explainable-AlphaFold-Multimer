Repository supplementing the CPSC 471 final project on the explainability of AlphaFold-Multimer

## Detailed instructions on running code

# Set up directories on Grace as follows:
Note: much of this project was designed to run on Grace. We recommend copying the following directories and their subdirectories from Github to Grace prior to running any code:
- Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/deletion_perturb_out
- Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/garbage_out
