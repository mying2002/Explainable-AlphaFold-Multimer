## Detailed instructions on running code

# Set up directories on Grace as follows:
Note: much of this project was designed to run on Grace. The following directories and their subdirectories must be copied from Github to Grace prior to running any code:
- Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/deletion_perturb_out
- Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/garbage_out
- Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/python_scripts
- Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/config_files
- Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/slurm_scripts
