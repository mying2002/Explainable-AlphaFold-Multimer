All csv files produced when running AlphaFold with the set of 45 selected monomers that make up the multimers studied in this work.

These csv files, among many other files which we do not use, are generated when running Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/slurm_scripts/run_monomer_perturb.sh in Grace and are deposited in the directory Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/monomer_garbage_out. One may copy these csv files from Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/monomer_garbage_out to this directory from the command line in Grace with the following commands:

cd Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/monomer_garbage_out

cp **/*.csv ../monomer_all_csv/
