Directory to store all of the output from running AlphaFold-Multimer in Grace on the set of antigen-antibody pairs that we study. Most of this output we do not use, with the exception of the csv file containing sequence ID and the full protein sequence, as well as the rank 1 predicted PDB file.

Note that the actual output we generate from running AlphaFold-Multimer is not on Github, due to the sheer number of files. The selected rank 1 PDB files we actually use are in Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/AA_multimer_all_pdb, and the csv files we actually use are in Explainable-AlphaFold-Multimer/AA_multimer_all_csv.
